# Tagmail

How annoying is it to create filters for every person and mailing list in our contacts?

The idea of this project was for the mail client to automatically allow filtering by several criteria, and to allow the user to promote these filters to first citizen filters for highlighting. This is all supported. Further features could be to allow further user tweaking of the first citizen filters.

There are currently two types of people. Those who know how to use email filters and those who do not. The point of this program is to make filters fun and accessible to everybody, making it easier to transit from automatic filters to manual ones.

Only POP3 is supported.

**Requirements:** it uses Python plus Gtk2, Gconf and sqlite. It should still run in any Linux system, if this older packages are installed.

If you find this interest, [let me know](mailto:ricardo.pdm.cruz@gmail.com). It should be easy to port to more recent versions of the libraries.
